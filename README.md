# MyReads React App

> This is my final project for Udacity React Fundamentals Course

## External dependencies

> This app depends on a books api provided by the creators of the course:

    https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter

> Specifically, **BooksAPI.js** is provided to interact with that service

> Also of note, the bookshelf ids need to be "read", "wantToRead", "currentlyReading"

## Running development server

```
./start_dev_server.sh
